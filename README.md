Hi I'm Minenhle Smith
Welcome to my portfolio
I'm a person who is armed with youthful vigor and an eagerness to learn more about technology.Each day unfolds as a chapter in my narrative of self discovery,where every interaction,setback and triumph shapes my evolving identity
About Me
I am an aspiring data scientist with a strong interest in healthcare analytics and responsible AI. I am motivated by using data to uncover meaningful patterns that support better decision-making in high-impact, real-world environments such as patient care and health systems. My goal is to build a career in healthcare-focused data science where ethical considerations, transparency, and real-world impact matter as much as technical accuracy.

Target Role
Healthcare-Focused Data Scientist

I am pursuing a data scientist role because it combines analysis, modelling, and critical thinking to solve complex problems with real human impact. Healthcare stands out to me as a domain where data-driven insights can genuinely improve lives, and where careful problem framing, evaluation, and communication are essential. I am currently focused on building strong foundations in data exploration, modelling, and data storytelling to prepare for this role.

Domain of Interest: Healthcare
Healthcare is the domain that fascinates me most due to its direct connection to people’s wellbeing and quality of life. Data in healthcare is complex, sensitive, and often imperfect, yet it plays a crucial role in decisions that affect patients and health systems. This combination of challenge, responsibility, and potential impact is what draws me to healthcare analytics and responsible AI.

Real-World Inspiration
One area of healthcare data science that inspires me is the use of predictive analytics to reduce hospital readmissions. Healthcare providers and research teams use patient demographic and clinical data to identify individuals at higher risk of being readmitted after discharge. These insights help clinicians target follow-up care and support more effectively, improving patient outcomes while reducing strain on healthcare systems.

Inspired by healthcare analytics work published in journals such as JAMA and BMJ, and case studies from organisations like Kaiser Permanente.

Reflections
This example highlights how data science can function as a decision-support tool rather than a replacement for clinical judgment. When used responsibly, these models can help allocate resources more effectively and improve patient experiences. At the same time, this work raises important questions around bias, fairness, interpretability, and trust—especially when models are trained on historical healthcare data. These challenges are a key reason why I am interested in responsible AI within healthcare.

Seed Project Ideas
Patient Risk Analysis Using Open Healthcare Data
Analyse an open healthcare dataset (such as hospital admissions or ICU patient data) to explore factors associated with patient deterioration or readmission risk.
Focus: Exploratory data analysis, feature understanding, and ethical considerations.

Predicting Hospital Readmissions
Build a simple classification model to estimate readmission risk using demographic and clinical features.
Focus: Data cleaning, model evaluation, and clear communication of assumptions and limitations.

Skills to Grow
Technical Skill: Python for Data Analysis and Modelling
I am developing proficiency in Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to support data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and basic machine learning—core skills for healthcare data science.

Soft Skill: Data Storytelling and Communication
Clear communication of insights, uncertainty, and trade-offs is essential in healthcare, where trust and understanding are critical for effective decision-making.

Goals
30-Day Goal
Complete a beginner-to-intermediate Python data analysis course and apply the skills to a small open healthcare dataset, producing a concise exploratory analysis.

6-Month Goal
Publish at least one complete healthcare-focused data science project on GitHub, including a clear problem statement, analysis, and reflection, and showcase it on this portfolio site.

Portfolio Purpose
This site serves as a living portfolio to document my learning journey, projects, and reflections as I grow toward a data scientist role in healthcare.
